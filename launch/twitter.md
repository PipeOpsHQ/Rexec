1/ I built Rexec: Terminal-as-a-Service for disposable dev environments + remote agent terminals. https://rexec.pipeops.io

2/ Spin up an isolated cloud terminal in seconds (Docker-backed), with a terminal UX that feels modern.

3/ It’s also great for AI-assisted workflows: generate code with an LLM, then run it + tests in an isolated terminal before it touches your machine.

4/ There’s also collaboration: share a terminal in view/control mode for pair debugging and demos.

5/ Need access to your own server/VM/local machine? Install the Rexec Agent — it connects outbound, so you don’t have to expose ports. Feedback welcome.
