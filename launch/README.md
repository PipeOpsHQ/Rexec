# Launch Plan (Rexec)

## One‑Line Pitch
Rexec gives you instantly available, network‑isolated terminals in the cloud — plus an agent to securely bring your own servers into the dashboard without opening SSH (great for safely running AI-generated code, too).

## Core Messaging
- **Fast**: start a terminal in seconds; reconnect without losing context.
- **Secure by default**: isolated sandboxes, token-based auth, least-privilege posture.
- **Unified access**: ephemeral cloud terminals + **your own machines** (agent) in one place.
- **Built for builders**: good terminal UX, collaboration modes, and automation hooks.
- **AI-friendly**: validate LLM-generated scripts/patches in an isolated environment before they touch your laptop or prod.

## Target Audiences
- DevOps/SREs needing safe “jump boxes” and short‑lived environments.
- Founders/indie hackers who want disposable dev envs with persistence where it matters.
- Security-conscious teams that want controlled access to servers without exposing ports.
- Teams experimenting with AI agents that need a controlled execution environment.

## Launch Checklist
### T‑7 to T‑3 days
- Freeze the landing copy, pricing, and screenshots.
- Ensure onboarding works: sign up → create terminal → connect → exit → return.
- Verify agent flow end‑to‑end: register → connect → open terminal → disconnect → reconnect.
- Prepare a lightweight demo video/gif (30–60s) showing both “cloud terminal” + “agent terminal”.

### T‑2 to T‑1 days
- Draft responses to likely questions (security model, pricing, self-hosting, roadmap).
- Queue posts: Product Hunt, HN, Reddit, Twitter/X.
- Create/verify launch assets in `launch/assets/`.

### Launch Day
- Post on Product Hunt early (and be present for comments).
- Post on HN as “Show HN” after your PH post is live.
- Post to 1–2 relevant subreddits (respect rules; disclose affiliation).
- Reply fast, collect feedback, and ship quick fixes.

## Outreach (Non‑Spam)
- Ask a small number of peers to try it and comment with honest feedback.
- If reaching out to high-profile devs (e.g., DHH, ThePrimeagen), keep it **one message**, short, and specific: what it is + why they might care + a link.
